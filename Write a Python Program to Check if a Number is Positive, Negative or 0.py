'''
The program takes input from the user for a number using float(input("Enter a number: ")).
It uses an if-elif-else statement to check if the entered number is positive, negative, or zero.
If the number is greater than 0, it prints "The entered number is positive."
If the number is less than 0, it prints "The entered number is negative."
If the number is neither greater nor less than 0 (i.e., it is equal to 0), it prints "The entered number is zero."
